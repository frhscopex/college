        <!-- <p>
          This project was developed as part of our internship training program, where we learned to apply the concepts of web development in a real-world scenario. The main objective was to not only build a functional system but also to understand the complete development cycle ‚Äî from planning and designing to coding, testing, and documentation.
          Through this project, our team collaborated on different roles such as frontend design, backend development, database integration, and content preparation. Working together gave us the chance to explore modern design practices, responsive layouts, smooth animations, and efficient server-side logic.
          The internship provided us with hands-on experience in solving practical challenges, improving problem-solving skills, and understanding how professional projects are structured. More importantly, it helped us build the habit of teamwork, clear communication, and sharing responsibilities to achieve a common goal.
          This training project reflects not only our technical learning but also our ability to work as a team and deliver something meaningful.
